## Features
1. **Customer Segmentation Prediction**:
   - Predicts customer segments based on input features like spending, transactions, and visit history.
   - Provides detailed descriptions and suggested action plans for each segment.

2. **AI Recommendations**:
   - Uses Groq AI (via Gemma2-9b-it model) to suggest additional strategies for retention and revenue growth.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizes historical customer data in a 2D scatter plot using PCA for easy interpretation.

4. **Interactive Navigation**:
   - `Prediction & AI Recommendations`: For customer predictions and AI insights.
   - `Further Analysis`: Links to explore additional analyses.
   - `About`: Explains technologies used in the project.
